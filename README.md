# Data Structures and Algorithms

*Data Structures and Algorithms* is a repository to document and collect possible coding interview questions in order to prepare myself for upcoming job interviews. I will document the question, one or more solutions, rationales and time and space complexity. I have chosen Python as implementation language, since I think it comes very near to pseudocode and helps me practicing the language itself. In addition I use C for solutions involving pointers or to answer C specific questions.

The questions are chosen or created from the following books:

* McDowel, Gayle Laakmann. *Cracking the Coding Interview*

* Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. *Introduction to Algorithms*

* Skiena Steven S. *The Algorithm Design Manual*
