# Data Structures and Algorithms

*Data Structures and Algorithms* is a repository to document and collect possible coding interview questions in order to prepare myself for upcoming job interviews. I will document the question, one or more solutions, rationales and time and space complexity. Python has been used for the implementations in order to practice the language itself. Python will, however, be replaced with Java as the reference implementation language. In addition I use C for solutions involving pointers or to answer C specific questions.

The questions are chosen or created from the following books:

* McDowel, Gayle Laakmann. *Cracking the Coding Interview*

* Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. *Introduction to Algorithms*

* Skiena Steven S. *The Algorithm Design Manual*

* John Mongan, Noah Suojanen, and Eric Gigu√®re. *Programming Interviews Exposed: Secrets to Landing Your Next Job*
