# Data Structures and Algorithms

*Data Structures and Algorithms* is a repository to document and collect possible coding interview questions in order to prepare myself for upcoming job interviews. I will document the question, one or more solutions, rationales and time and space complexity. Python is used for the implementations in order to practice the language itself. In addition I use C for solutions involving pointers or to answer C specific questions.

The questions are chosen or created from the following books:

* McDowel, Gayle Laakmann. *Cracking the Coding Interview*

* Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. *Introduction to Algorithms*

* Skiena Steven S. *The Algorithm Design Manual*
